# MIP-X14: Expanded Rollout of Solidity Labs' OEV Solution Across Base and OP Mainnet (Phase 1)

## **Simple Summary**

Following the successful implementation of
[MIP-O12](https://moonwell.fi/governance/proposal/moonbeam?id=153), this
proposal represents Phase 1 of a two-phase expansion of Solidity Labs' Oracle
Extracted Value (OEV) solution across eligible Moonwell markets on OP Mainnet
and Base. This initial phase will enable OEV capture in non-composite oracle
markets, ensuring a smooth and controlled rollout before expanding to more
complex composite oracle markets in a future proposal. By extending OEV beyond
the initial ETH Core Market on OP Mainnet, this upgrade will increase protocol
revenue, attract greater MEV searcher (bot) participation, and create a more
efficient liquidation system.

## **Key Terms**

- **Liquidations:** The process of resolving underwater loans to maintain the
  health and stability of the Moonwell protocol.
- **Chainlink Price Oracles:** Trusted price feeds used for secure and accurate
  liquidation triggers.
- **Non-Composite Oracle**: An oracle that provides direct price feeds without
  aggregating multiple sources or performing complex calculations. These are
  simpler to integrate and are prioritized in the first phase of the rollout.
- **Composite Oracle**: An oracle that aggregates multiple data sources or
  applies additional logic before producing a final price feed. These require
  additional considerations and will be activated in the second phase of the
  rollout.
- **Oracle Extracted Value (OEV):** The value or revenue captured when price
  updates from oracles trigger liquidations of undercollateralized loans.
- **Mempool:** A temporary storage area where pending transactions are held
  before being included in a blockchain block. It acts as a queue, allowing
  nodes to validate and broadcast transactions across the network. Miners or
  validators select transactions from the mempool, often prioritizing those with
  higher fees, for inclusion in the next block.
- **MEV Relay:** A service that captures and redistributes Maximum Extractable
  Value (MEV) by enabling searchers and validators to prioritize transactions in
  a block via off-chain auctions. These relays maximize value from opportunities
  like arbitrage, liquidation, or front-running, while often sharing a portion
  of the captured value with users or protocols.
- **MEV Tax:** A protocol-level fee charged to participants seeking to capture
  MEV, such as liquidators. This tax ensures that a portion of the MEV generated
  by prioritized transactions, like liquidations, is captured directly by the
  Moonwell protocol, rather than being retained by third parties or off-chain
  systems.

## **How It Works**

1. Liquidators bid for priority access to execute liquidations by attaching a
   **priority fee** to their transactions.
2. The system charges a **MEV tax** based on the priority fee, ensuring the
   highest bidder's transaction succeeds.
3. If no bids are placed, liquidations revert to the **default liquidation
   mechanism** after 10 seconds, using updated Chainlink price feeds.

## **Security Measures**

- **Chainlink Integration:** The system wraps Chainlink's price feeds, ensuring
  no change to oracle trust assumptions.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** If no priority fee is bid, traditional liquidations
  can occur after a 10-second delay.
- **Audited Contracts:** Contracts have undergone a comprehensive security audit
  by Halborn Security.

## **Background and Success of MIP-O12**

MIP-O12 introduced a **MEV tax** mechanism that allows for the Moonwell protocol
to capture additional revenue from liquidation events. The initial rollout on
the ETH Core Market on OP Mainnet demonstrated promising results, as evidenced
by the following successful liquidation transactions:

- **[OEV Example 1](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x1e41a6e70674c421dc27a96cc29f6b201b589eeb9e8ce374d21df8f105448051)**
- **[OEV Example 2](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x44aea3f66f5a938645616ee7159b18ee1c081d965caafcbf3331a2af123206c0)**

This groundbreaking solution has also garnered significant attention within the
Optimism Superchain ecosystem. The official Optimism X account recently
highlighted Moonwell's success in implementing the first onchain OEV auction on
the network, and by doing so recapturing value that was previously lost to
external actors. Read the full thread
[here](https://x.com/Optimism/status/1886505186853839014).

While these initial results are very promising, overall participation was
limited due to the lack of full MEV searcher integration. This expanded rollout
is expected to drive exponentially higher MEV searcher participation, increasing
competition and further optimizing liquidation processes.

## **Motivation for Expanded Rollout**

Following the successful test run initiated with the passage of MIP-O12, the
next logical step is to extend OEV capture across all supported markets. A
broader implementation will:

- **Encourage MEV bot adoption:** With only one active market, MEV searchers had
  limited incentive to integrate. An expanded rollout creates higher-value
  opportunities, attracting a more diverse selection of participants.
- **Increase protocol revenue:** As competition for liquidations grows, more
  revenue will be captured by Moonwell's protocol reserves.
- **Improve overall efficiency:** A wider implementation ensures more markets
  benefit from enhanced liquidation execution and fair value capture.
- **Phased rollout strategy:** By first targeting markets with non-composite
  oracles, we reduce complexity before expanding to markets utilizing composite
  oracles.

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Expansion to Non-Composite Oracle Markets**

The first phase will focus on enabling OEV capture on markets using
**non-composite oracles**, which are simpler to integrate. This approaches
minimizes protocol changes and reduces complexity.

### **Phase 2: Expansion to Composite Oracle Markets**

Upon successful execution and monitoring of Phase 1, Moonwell DAO may choose to
proceed with enabling OEV on **composite oracle** markets, enabling
protocol-wide integration.

## **Supported Markets for OEV Activation (Phase 1)**

### **OP Mainnet Markets:**

- WETH
- USDC
- DAI
- USDT
- OP
- VELO
- weETH

### **Base Markets:**

- WETH
- cbBTC
- EURC
- WELL
- USDS
- TBTC
- VIRTUAL

## **Next Steps**

1. **Phase 1 Expansion:** Integrate OEV solution on **non-composite oracle
   markets** on Base and OP Mainnet.
2. **Community and MEV Engagement:** Solidity Labs will distribute educational
   materials and establish direct lines with **MEV searcher operators** to
   increase participation.
3. **Performance Review & Adjustments:** Measure key metrics and iterate based
   on results.
4. **Phase 2 Expansion:** Extend to **composite oracle markets** on Base and OP
   Mainnet following review and passage of an additional Moonwell Improvement
   Proposal.

## **Voting Options**

- **Yay:** Approve the expanded rollout of Solidity Labs OEV solution across
  non-composite oracle markets on **Base and OP Mainnet**.
