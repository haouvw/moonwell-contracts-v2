Previous Proposal:** MIP-X08: Renewal of Moonwell Vaults Incentives Program and
Frontier cbBTC Vault Ownership Transfer

### **Summary**

This proposal seeks to continue the successful Moonwell Morpho Vaults incentives
program for an additional 90-day period. The Moonwell Flagship and Frontier
vaults have consistently demonstrated strong performance and have become a
cornerstone of Moonwell's lending ecosystem on Base. To maintain momentum and
ensure continued competitive rewards for vault depositors, this proposal
requests a grant of 10M WELL tokens.

Following the recommendations from BlockAnalitica, the grant will be allocated
across the following four vaults to optimize liquidity and address market
demand:

- **USDC:** 50%
- **ETH:** 24%
- **EURC:** 13%
- **cbBTC:** 13%

The program is scheduled to commence on or around Tuesday, June 17th, to
minimize any gap in rewards for liquidity providers. The 10M WELL tokens will be
transferred from the Foundation's multisig on Base to the Morpho URD to fund
this 90-day incentive period.

### **Success of the Ongoing Program**

The Moonwell Morpho Vaults have established themselves as the dominant market
leader on Morpho's Base deployment, consistently attracting significant Total
Value Locked (TVL) and a large, active user base. The program's achievements
underscore the community's strong appetite for optimized lending solutions and
the effectiveness of the strategic incentives provided.

The continued growth and high levels of adoption across the USDC, ETH, EURC, and
cbBTC vaults validate the success of this initiative. The dynamic allocation
model and robust risk management have provided risk-adjusted returns for
suppliers and competitive rates for borrowers, solidifying Moonwell's leadership
position within the Base ecosystem. Renewing these incentives is crucial to
sustain this performance and continue fostering a vibrant and liquid lending
market.

### **Current Vault TVL**

- As of June 2025, the vaults maintain a significant amount of Morpho TVL:
  - Moonwell Flagship ETH Vault (Base): \$27.3M
  - Moonwell Flagship EURC Vault (Base): \$8.388M
  - Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault (Base): \$22.7M
  - Moonwell Flagship cbBTC Vault (Base): \$16.65M
  - Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault (OP Mainnet): \$1.6M
  - Total Vault TVL: \$76M

### **Proposed Incentive Renewal Terms**

- **Total WELL Tokens:** 10M WELL
- **Incentivized Vaults & Allocation:**
  - Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault: 5,000,000 WELL (50%)
  - Moonwell Flagship ETH Vault: 2,400,000 WELL (24%)
  - Moonwell Flagship EURC Vault: 1,300,000 WELL (13%)
  - Moonwell Frontier cbBTC Vault: 1,300,000 WELL (13%)
- **Duration:** 90 days
- **Start Date:** Approximately June 17th
- **Distribution:** The incentives will be distributed over the 90-day period to
  maintain consistent rewards.

### **Implementation**

Upon the successful passage of this proposal, the following action will be
executed:

- **Transfer 10M WELL** from the F-BASE (Foundation on Base) multisig:
  `0x74Cbb1E8B68dDD13B28684ECA202a351afD45EAa` to the Morpho URD contract:
  `0x9e3380f8B29E8f85cA19EFFA80Fb41149417D943`.

The Foundation will be responsible for bridging the 10M WELL to Base and
approving the Temporal Governor to spend the 10M WELL before the proposal's
passage to ensure a seamless transition.

### **Voting Options**

- **Yay:** Approve the grant of 10M WELL token incentives for the Moonwell
  Flagship and Frontier Vaults for a 90-day period.
- **Nay:** Reject the renewal of the WELL token incentives.
- **Abstain:** Choose to participate in the vote without expressing support for
  or opposition to the proposal.

### **Conclusion**

The renewal of the Moonwell Vaults incentives program is of utmost strategic
importance to build upon our established market leadership and continue
delivering value to our customers. By allocating 10M WELL over 90 days, we can
ensure that our key vaults remain highly attractive to liquidity providers,
thereby sustaining the growth and dynamism of the Moonwell ecosystem on Base.
This proposal reaffirms our commitment to providing secure, simple, and
accessible onchain finance for all.
