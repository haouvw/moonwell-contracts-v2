# **MIP-B43: Add cbXRP to Base Core Markets**

## cbXRP: Short Summary

We are pleased to present a proposal for adding **Coinbase Wrapped XRP (cbXRP)**
to **Moonwell’s Base Core Markets**. cbXRP is a fully‑collateralised, ERC‑20
representation of XRP that is minted and redeemed 1‑for‑1 through Coinbase. The
listing would bring a blue‑chip, payments‑oriented asset to the protocol, deepen
liquidity on Moonwell, and attract new retail and institutional users familiar
with XRP.

cbXRP is new, and as a result has a few liquidity concerns, but it shows
substantial benefits to the Moonwell community.

## Benefits to the Moonwell Community

1. **Enhanced Liquidity & Volume**  
   Issuance by Coinbase immediately bootstraps liquidity on Aerodrome and
   Uniswap v4.
2. **Stable Collateral Type**  
   Tight 1‑for‑1 peg to XRP backed by a regulated custodian.
3. **New User Acquisition**  
   XRP has one of the largest retail followings (3 M+ on X), offering growth
   potential for Moonwell.
4. **Diversification**  
   Adds a non‑USD‑pegged, large‑cap asset that is uncorrelated with ETH/Layer‑2
   governance tokens.

## Market Risk Assessment

### Market Metrics (Source)

- **Market Cap:** \$5 M
- **Minimum/Maximum Market Cap (Last 6 months):** \$0 (December 5 2024) / \$5 M
  (June 5 2025)
- **Circulating Supply:** 2.3 M cbXRP
- **Maximum Supply:** 2.3 M cbXRP
- **24‑Hour Trading Volume:** \$341000 (first day of trading on Aerodrome)

### Liquidity on Centralized Exchanges

_Not applicable_ — cbXRP is an on‑chain deployment of XRP.

### Holder Concentration

- **Herfindahl Index:** 0.88 (on Base) – indicates significant concentration
  among wallets for cbXRP.

> Note: Ripple and Coinbase are reputable companies, and cbXRP borrows from
> Coinbase’s reserve supply, so this may not fully reflect governance risk.

## Decentralization

- **Top 10 Holders:** Majority in a Coinbase wallet followed by an Aerodrome LP.
- **Token Contract:** `0xcb585250f852c6c6bf90434ab21a00f02833a4af`
- cbXRP operates as an on‑chain Ethereum‑native deployment of XRP, backed by
  Coinbase reserves.
- All administrative roles and access are through Coinbase or Ripple.

### Governance Structure

- Coinbase‑wrapped assets are held in custody by Coinbase and are subject to
  Coinbase Custody rules (jurisdiction‑dependent).

### Blacklist Functionality

- The cbXRP contract includes `blacklist` and `unBlacklist` functions and a
  public getter to check blacklist status.

## Smart Contract Risks

### Codebase and On‑Chain Activity

- Smart contract:
  <https://basescan.org/token/0xcb585250f852c6c6bf90434ab21a00f02833a4af#code>
- Holders: 264 (as of the first day).

### Security Posture

- Deployed under the same wrapped‑asset framework audited by OpenZeppelin. Audit
  details: <https://blog.openzeppelin.com/coinbase-liquid-staking-token-audit>

### Upgradeability

- Upgradeable under an `Admin` role (likely a Coinbase multisig).

## Oracle Assessment

- **Chainlink price feed:** `0x9f0C1dD78C4CBdF5b9cf923a549A201EdC676D34`
- cbXRP price tracks native XRP through Coinbase reserves. Supply on Base is
  capped by Coinbase Custody.

## Swap Size Requirement

cbXRP currently does **not** meet the MALF swap‑size requirements; however, it
has only been live for a few days.

---

## Liquidity Threshold

![Liquidity-Threshold](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex017/uploads/moonwell/original/2X/a/ac3f732dc38307efa3922ce3cc9f16d0529c93bc.png)
Currently, the liquidity does not meet the \$2M threshold Moonwell has under
MALF; however, seeing as though liquidity on Aerodrome has already hit 8% of
that goal in a day, it is not far fetched to see it hitting this threshold
sooner rather than later.

---

## Commercial Viability

Even if cbXRP never rises above cbETH’s historical utilisation peak (~33%), a
\$2 M liquidity seed, with one‑third borrowed at ~10% APY, would generate
roughly \$90000 annual interest. After Moonwell’s 10-15% reserve cut, protocol
revenue would be just over \$1100 per month—above the MALF threshold, with
headroom for growth.

## Gauntlet's Risk Analysis and Recommendations

### Initial Risk Parameters

| **Parameter**          | **Value**       |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Collateral Factor (CF) | 70%             |
| Supply Cap             | 1,000,000 cbXRP |
| Borrow Cap             | 500,000 cbXRP   |
| Protocol Seize Share   | 30%             |

### Interest Rate Model

| **Parameter**   | **Value** |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Base Rate       | 0%        |
| Multiplier      | 23%       |
| Jump Multiplier | 5×        |
| Kink            | 45%       |
| Reserve Factor  | 30%       |

### Supporting Data

- **Liquidity:** Total DEX TVL for cbXRP pairs on Aerodrome (cbXRP/WETH and
  cbXRP/cbBTC) is roughly **$900 k**, and liquidity doubled within 12 hours on
  **June&nbsp;5, 2025**.
- **Circulating Supply:** About **2.3 M cbXRP** are in circulation on Base, with
  Coinbase custody wallets holding ~91 %.
- **Slippage:** A simulated sale of **500 k cbXRP** would incur **40 – 50 %**
  price slippage under current conditions; setting conservative supply/borrow
  caps mitigates this risk while liquidity deepens.
- **Price Volatility:** Over the last 180 days, XRP’s annualized daily log
  returns have spanned from a high of +25% to a low of -13%, underscoring the
  asset’s sensitivity to both upward trends and downward corrections. The
  current 30-day annualized log volatility is 60%, which is generally closer to
  other volatile blue chip assets. XRP’s price is primarily influenced by
  regulatory developments, most notably the SEC lawsuit, which shape investor
  confidence and institutional adoption. Broader market sentiment, macroeconomic
  conditions, and Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions also play
  key roles in driving demand. Liquidity, exchange listings, and on-chain
  activity (like escrow releases) affect short-term volatility. Overall, XRP
  tends to be less volatile than many other crypto assets due to its established
  utility and relatively deep liquidity.

## Conclusion

Listing **cbXRP** as a core asset on Moonwell unlocks significant potential for
protocol growth, liquidity expansion, and user adoption. While some risks
remain—particularly liquidity depth and holder concentration—cbXRP’s stable,
compliance‑ready design aligns with Moonwell’s mission of simple, secure, and
accessible DeFi. We invite the community to engage in discussion and help shape
this proposal to best serve Moonwell’s long‑term vision.
